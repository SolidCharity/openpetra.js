required packages:
 sudo (for the initialisation of the database)
 mono-openpetra package, available for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS from http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpetraorg/files/openpetraorg/mono-openpetra/
 one of the following RDBMS:
   postgresql (recommended, default)
   mysql

The default configuration for the server is to use postgresql. But mysql should now work as well. Sqlite is not recommended for the use on Linux with this tar.gz file.

firewall: 
in order for clients to connect from outside, you need to open port 80 (or 443)
eg if you are using iptables, add such a line:
/sbin/iptables -A int-in -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 80

For initialising the installation:
rename the sample configuration file and change it if you want:
cp config-sample.sh config.sh
Run that file: . config.sh
then run: . setup.sh

To load the initial database:
  /etc/init.d/MyOpenPetra init

To start the server, type:
  /etc/init.d/MyOpenPetra start

To see the menu and administrate the server, type:
  /etc/init.d/MyOpenPetra menu

To install a base database:
  Download one of the available databases from https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpetraorg/files/openpetraorg/demodata/
  then go into the OpenPetra menu, and use option i for importing the database from the yml.gz file

To stop the server, type:
  /etc/init.d/MyOpenPetra stop

To backup the database, type:
  /etc/init.d/MyOpenPetra backup

To restore the database from a backup, type:
  /etc/init.d/MyOpenPetra restore

To see the technical interface of the server:
  go to http://<yourserver>/openpetra9000/serverSessionManager.asmx
