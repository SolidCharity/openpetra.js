<ul>
<li>Fix bug that prevented opening the gift batch screen, and the change of the password (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openpetraorg/view.php?id=136">Bug 136</a>).</li>

<li>User defined settings for the reports are now maintained in the user directory, but the default settings are kept centrally in the programs directory.</li>
<li>Export of GL Batches has been added. Still needs testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.2: 9 September 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<ul>
<li>Plenty of maintenance screens have been added, most of them have been developed by volunteers! With these maintenance screens the user now can maintain most of the lookup fields, eg. occupation codes, etc</li>
<li>We have plenty of more reports for the Conference module, Partner module and Finance module. Some of them are not much of use yet, since the data cannot be entered yet. But some can be used already with existing databases which are upgraded from Petra 2.x.</li>
<li>The new report "Partner by Special Type" has been added for a small charity in the UK, to list all partners and their address who have been tagged with special attributes (eg. Donor, Newsletter subscriber, Potential co-worker, etc).</li>
<li>GL Batches screen has been improved: You can now cancel batches, delete journals, delete transactions, and import GL batches from CSV files. Also the credit and debit totals are summarized at the top of the screen. You can filter for unposted or all batches.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with the checked list box control, and the grid we use on many windows.</li>
<li>Icons have now transparent background again.</li>
<li>The permissions system is now implemented, ie. the modules are greyed out if you don't have access to that module.</li>
<li>The normal DEMO user does not have SYSADMIN rights anymore, and therefore to create new users etc, you have to login with user SYSADMIN and password CHANGEME (important: all letters of the password CHANGEME are uppercase!). For production use, you are urgently requested to change the password for the SYSADMIN user, and to create a new user for yourself and to deactivate the DEMO user!</li>
<li>The standalone installer now supports several OpenPetra installations in parallel. If you choose the default Groupname, nothing will change. But if you change the default groupname, please note that your previous database might still be in C:\Documents and Settings\{Your user name}\Application Data\OpenPetra.org\db30. You might want to copy the file petra.db to C:\Documents and Settings\{Your user name}\Application Data\{Your selected Groupname}\db30.</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.1: 19 June 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<ul>
<li>This version marks the change from pre-alpha status to Alpha.
This means that this version of OpenPetra shows quite clearly what OpenPetra is capable of.
There is also an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/openpetraorg/index.php?title=Basic_Tutorial">english tutorial with sample data on the OpenPetra wiki</a>,
and you are welcome to use the tutorial to discover the functionality of OpenPetra.
Unfortunately we have to discourage the production use of OpenPetra at this moment in time, but we invite you to thoroughly explore the features of OpenPetra.</li>
<li>You can now add new Special Types for the Partner Edit screen.</li>
<li>Big improvements for the Partner Edit screen. You can now create and edit persons, families, organisations etc.</li>
<li>It is now possible to have really secure encryption with Public/Private key. Previously, we only had encryption with one single private key which was not so safe since the private key needed to be shared between the client and the server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.0.15.0: 02 June 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<ul>
<li>Create new Ledgers. All available ledgers are automatically available in the navigation menu.</li>
<li>Import partners from CSV: this will help to import addresses from other sources. You have to confirm each address, and the system will tell you if the partner already exists in the database.</li>
<li>The Form letter for first time donors is now part of the OpenPetra system.</li>
<li>When sending the form letter, you can create an Extract of all partner keys that will receive the letter, and you can create an entry in their contact history.</li>
<li>There is a new screen that allows searching the contact history of all partners, and allows deleting of contact history, in case something was entered incorrectly. The contact history will soon be part of the Partner Edit screen as well.</li>
<li>The main navigation screen has been tidied up, we have no demo section anymore, but all functionality can be found in the respective module.</li>
<li>User management: add users, change password, assign group membership for permissions (to be implemented later).</li>
<li>We have added a number of new reports for partners and addresses: Brief Address Report, Brief Foundation Report, Supporting Churches Report, Valid Bank Account Report, Publication Statistical Report, Bulk Address Report</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would allow closing OpenPetra even if screens were still open with unsaved changes.</li>
<li>We have included some sample files for you to experiment with, and an empty database for starting your own production database.</li>
<li>Previously when installing a new version of OpenPetra standalone, the SQLite database has been backed up, and a fresh version of the current demo database was installed. This version is the first that will upgrade an existing OpenPetra database, and you will be able to continue with your own data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.0.14.0: 03 April 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Improved handling of Gift batches and transactions, now supporting split gifts (donor gives a donation that are split into several recipients/projects)<br/>
Initial support for importing finance transaction from a bank statement of type MT940<br/>
The reports did not work in the previous releases, and now work again<br/>
The amounts and dates are displayed with nicer formatting in the data grids<br/>
Improvements to data loading for Postgresql (sequences did not work in previous release)<br/>

<h3>0.0.13.0: 08 March 2010</h3>

<br/>
Several bug fixes for import and export of data, was missing the sequences etc.<br/>
Editing gifts should now work. Previously the donor was not stored.<br/>
Fixes for Client installer.<br/>
Optional: login screen can now remember the user name.<br/>

<h3>0.0.12.0: 15 February 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
OpenPetra now supports Mysql as well as Postgresql and Sqlite.<br/>
The Remote Client installer and the patchtool now work with Windows Vista (and probably Windows 7 as well).<br/>
Export the database to text file, and import it into another OpenPetra installation. This allows easy migration between Standalone and Hosted installations, or between different database types.<br/>
Matching of gifts now works.<br/>
Printing of gifts receipts (form letters) has been implemented.<br/>

<h3>0.0.11.0: 11 January 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
This version now supports importing partners from a Yml file.<br/>
The patchtool works now, this allows easy upgrades on the client side.<br/>
The server version now uses encryption to secure the communication between client and server.<br/>
It is possible to use a plugin dll for authentication against other services (eg. LDAP, phpBB database, etc).<br/>

<h3>0.0.10.0: 13 November 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Import of account hierarchy works now. New accounts will be created automatically. This helps with customizing OpenPetra to the specific needs of an organisation.<br/>
Import of foreign currency exchange rates works now. This helps with displaying reports in international currency for auditors from other countries.<br/>
Income/Expense Sheet, Balance Sheet, and Account Detail reports now work and have been tested. Of course they still need improvements, especially for allowing the user which columns to print, reporting by quarter, etc.<br/>
GL transactions can be imported from Excel sheets (CSV files), with each column representing an account, and values in those columns are assigned to the correct accounts. A data definition file describes the date and currency format, and the account names for each column. This functionality can be adjusted for other situations; in the current case we can use it to import historic data from another office.<br/>

<h3>0.0.9.0: 12 October 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
AP payments can now be created for posted AP documents, and the payments are posted to GL. Partial payments are not supported yet, neither are payments in different currencies.<br/>
The account hierarchy can now be displayed in a treeview, and new accounts can be added. It does not work yet to move accounts around in the hierarchy, neither can you delete accounts yet.<br/>
You can export the account hierarchy to CSV, YML, or XML. This will help with editing the account hierarchy in an editor you prefer. The import of these files does not work yet.<br/>

<h3>0.0.8.0: 21 September 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Posting of AP documents works now.<br/>
The new navigation system is basically working, though it should be extended soon to allow the user to customize it, and context sensitive search boxes will be added as well.<br/>
A new Demo folder has been added to the new navigation system to show the functionality that has already been implemented.<br/>
The classic navigation systems with the deep and complicated menu structure is still available, via a toolbar button.

<h3>0.0.7.0: 05 September 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Some bugs from the previous release with Partner Edit and Partner Find have been fixed.<br/>
Those screens should now work better with Linux and Mac.<br/>
Posting of GL batches works now!<br/>
There is the report for Account details, which should show the transactions and balances affected.<br/>

<h3>0.0.6.0: 19 August 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
The General Ledger Batch/Journal/Transaction screen is now looking much better, and you can actually store batches, journals and transactions.
You can select Account codes and Cost centre codes for transactions.
<br/><br/>
A few improvements have been added to the Accounts Payable screens, hopefully there are less exceptions than before.

<h3>0.0.5.0: 25 July 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
It is now possible in Accounts Payable to create invoices and add invoice details, and store them. You can search for the supplier, and open the invoices and credit notes of that supplier.
<br/>
There is a first preview of the General Ledger Batch/Journal/Transaction screen, without any functionality yet.
<br/>
There is a first preview of simple maintenance screens, examples are Currency Setup and Exchange Rate Setup screens. They don't have functionality yet.
<br/><br/>
The point of these preview screens is to show how easy it is using scaffolding to generate new screens. 
The screens in the Accounts Payable module already have most of their functionality automatically generated, just a few special cases need to be programmed manually.

<h3>0.0.4.0: 13 July 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
The main new feature is the Accounts Payable supplier edit screen where you can edit new suppliers. For testing, first create a partner of type Organisation in the Partner module, and 
then go into the finance module, select Accounts Payable, and click on new supplier. It works to save the supplier, and to search for the supplier by either partner name or partner key.
The search box remembers the last 30 searches and autocompletes.
<br/>
Previews of the invoice edit screen and the supplier transaction screen have also been added, but they don't have functionality yet.
<br/><br/>
Some smaller bugs have been fixed, eg. when closing the partner edit screen with changed data and then saving when asked. Also the Partner Find now works with the enter key.
<br/><br/>
This release now supports PostgreSQL server again, the support was broken in 0.0.3.
<br/><br/>
This release comes not only with a standalone installer, but also with a server installer for Linux. That server installer only works with Postgresql at the moment. Please see the file INSTALL in the linux server tar.gz archive.
There is now also a remote client installer for Windows for OpenPetra installations that connect to a Linux server.

<h3>0.0.3.0: 20 June 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
The new thing is that you can create a translation, and the Petra Client will use any language file that is located eg. in C:\Program Files\OpenPetra.org\bin30\locale\de\LC_MESSAGES. 
You might need to set the LANGUAGE variable in your Windows Environment Variables to use another language than is installed.
We do welcome translations, please have a look on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/openpetraorg/index.php?title=HowTo_help_with_Translation">wiki for instructions</a>.
<br/><br/>
The Finance module main screen can now be opened, and two prototype screens are available, for Gift processing from bank statements, and the main screen for Accounts Payable.
<br/><br/>
Please note that your database file will be replaced, and the backup you can still find here: eg. C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\OpenPetra.org\db30\petra.db.1.bak; we hope to integrate a patching system soon.
<br/><br/>
Some of the issues in the previous versions have been fixed, eg. the date in the Partner by city report does work now.

<h3>0.0.2.0: 13 June 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
The main visible new functionality is the &quot;Partner By City&quot; report. 
To test it, create a few partners in Partner Edit, and then run the report for those cities.
At the moment, this is limited to partners of type FAMILY; and there also seems to be a bug: 
if an address is only valid from today, the report would not show it; so set the valid date to a past date.
<br/><br/>
You may also notice the status bar with context sensitive help, depending on the field that currently is in focus. 
This is for example useful on Partner Edit, when it tells the meaning for each field.

<h3>0.0.1.3: 1 June 2009</h3>
This is the initial release of OpenPetra.org.<br/>
It only comes as a Standalone installation, using SQLite, to make the installation very simple.<br/>
<br/>
Login with User ID <b>demo</b> and password is <b>demo</b> as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are only 2 screens that actually provide functionality:<br/>
Go into the Partner module, and in the menu select &quot;Partner&quot; / &quot;New Partner&quot;.<br/>
You can create a new partner, add an address, and save the partner.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can go in the Partner Main screen in the menu to &quot;Partner&quot; / &quot;Find & Maintain Partner&quot;.<br/>
Search for the partner you just created.<br/>
To edit the partner, double click on the row in the result grid.<br/>
